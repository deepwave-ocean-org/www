Tigran Hamasyan's _Markos and Markos_ from his 2017 album _An Ancient Observer._ Video by Naira Muradyan.

Inspired by Zahrad’s poem Marc and Marc

Marc and Marc Went to the seaside And, by the lighthouse Marc, together with Marc (since both were Marcs) Were washing their feet Look, Marc Said Marc to Marc A shooting star just fell Marc looked down Into the sea You lied, said Marc to Marc When they got Their feet dry A little star was stuck On Marc’s foot
